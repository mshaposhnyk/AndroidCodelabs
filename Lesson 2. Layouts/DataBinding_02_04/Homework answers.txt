1. Why do you want to minimize explicit and implicit calls to findViewById()?
  -Every time findViewById() is called, it traverses the view hierarchy.
  -These calls can slow down the user interface.
  -findViewById() runs on the main or UI thread.

2. How would you describe data binding?
  -The big idea about data binding is to create an object that connects/maps/binds two pieces of distant
   information together at compile time, so that you don't have to look for the data at runtime.

3. Which of the following is NOT a benefit of data binding?
   -Calling findViewById() generates a compiler error.

4. What is the function of the <layout> tag?
   -You wrap it around your root view in the layout.
   -Bindings are created for all the views in a layout.
   -You can use the <data> tag in inside a <layout> to bind a variable to a data class.

5. Which is the correct way to reference bound data in the XML layout?
   -android:text="@={myDataClass.property}"
