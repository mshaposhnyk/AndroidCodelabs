1. If you pass arguments from Fragment A to Fragment B without using Safe Args to make sure your arguments are type-safe, which of the following problems can occur that might cause the app to crash when the app runs? Select all that apply.
  -Fragment B requests data that Fragment A doesn't send to it.
  -Fragment A might send data that Fragment B hasn't requested.
  -Fragment A might send data that's a different type than Fragment B needs. For example, Fragment A might send a string but Fragment B requests an integer, resulting in a return value of zero.

2. What does the Safe Args Gradle plugin do? Select all that apply:
  -Makes it so you don't need to use Android bundles in your code.
  -Generates a method for each action that you've defined in the navigation graph.
  -Prevents your code from using the wrong key when extracting data from a bundle.

3. What's an implicit intent?
   -A task that your app initiates without knowing which app or Activity will handle the task.
